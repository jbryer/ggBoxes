Description: A ggplot2 layer to create two-dimensional box and whisker
    plots. The boxes use the same statistics as a typical box plots with
    the inner box corresponding to the inter-quartile range (IQR) and the
    outer box corresponding to 1.5 times the IQR or the larges
    observation, whichever is smaller. Any points lying outside that range
    are plotted as points.
